# Insights from Data Course Projects

This repository contains projects I have completed during the "Insight from Data" course in University of Eastern Finland. The course involved data analysis using R. It included exploring and analyzing real-life-like datasets. Topics covered in the course included clustering, data cleaning and visualization among others. Each folder contains a PDF report where I detail the entire process of the project, as well as the R script used.

# Exploring the Pima Indians Dataset: Clustering and classification
In this project I explored and analyzed the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. The dataset
originates from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The primary
goal was to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. For
detailed information, refer to the following link:

The project consists of two main components: clustering and classification.

# Exploring the Vaalikone Dataset: Cluster Analysis
In this project, I explored and analyzed the Candidate Selector dataset (vaalikone_questions_all.csv) with the aim of clustering candidates based on their responses. The goal was to investigate whether these clusters align with political parties or other factors present in the Vaalikone Profiles (vaalikone_profiles_all.csv).

# Data Exploration: the mpg dataset
In this project, I explored the "mpg" dataset, which is readily available upon loading the ggplot2
package in R. This dataset comprises 234 observations of various car models, each accompanied by
multiple attributes, including fuel economy, engine type, and drive type. The primary objective of this analysis is to uncover insights into the factors that influence fuel efficiency.
